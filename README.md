# Bootstrap

I liked using Bootstrap for the framework, it's easy to use and didn't take me long to understand it.  

I followed a tutorial on youtube and then created my own webside from that tutorial.
For this website I played with the Bootstrap Icons and used the Bootstrap defult colors and played with them a little bit with opacity. I also overwrote some colors (in the header f.x) in css to make the site look better.  

I created a Responsive Navbar, Newsletter With Input Group, Boxes With Bootstrap Grid & Cards and a Footer with an arrow which leads you back to the top. I hope you like my project!
